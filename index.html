<p>The starting point from this application is from the repository <a href="https://github.com/ike54/sampleApp">SampleApp</a>.  SampleApp is the result of Isaac Karrer engaging in the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em></a> by <a href="http://michaelhartl.com/">Michael Hartl</a>.  Once the Microposts model, table and tests are removed all that remains is an application where users may register, login, change passwords, and choose an avatar via gravatar.</p>

<p>This is parking spot locator application for Data Mining at Texas State
the application has the name 'Parking' until further development and a name is chosen.</p>

<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/bigike54">Isaac Karrer</a></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>When a user requests to park, user parking history would be used to list the probability to find a spot in their preffered lot.  Lots in close proximitity to the preferred lot and their probabilities could also be listed.</p>

<ul>
<li>The GPS coordinates could also be used to estimate the time it would take for a user to travel from the location where they requeseted to park, to their parking spot in a chosen lot.</li>
<li>Combining the estimated time to reach the requested lot, the number of users currently en route to the lot, the number of people per time segment who successfully find a spot, and the number of people who could not find a spot and aborted a parking attempt per time segment, a probabilty to find a spot for that moment could be calculated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a user parks, GPS coordinates may be used to create a prioritized list of the parking lots in which the user may be currently located, with an option to select the parking lot from a full list if the parking lot does not appear in the original list.</p>

<ul>
<li>The list would be used to confirm which lot the user found a spot to park in. Additionally the list could be used when the user has found open spots while walking through the parking lot.</li>
<li>A user's parking spot may be located on the border between two lots.  GPS on an Android device is not accurate enough to determine which lot a person is located.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><h1>
<a name="to-do-list" class="anchor" href="#to-do-list"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>To Do List</h1>

<ul>
<li>Create RESTful API for all controller methods except for ones which require an admin user, e.g. delete</li>
<li>Create Android application for sending REST API requests for user registration, login, Request to Park, Abort Park, Parked, Open Spot Found, etc.</li>
<li>Remove Microposts</li>
<li>Remove ability to change email login</li>
<li>Create ability to recover password</li>
<li>Create an active mailer to confirm a user has a Texas State email address and recover password

<ul>
<li>Add Confirmation Code and Confrimed fields to user model</li>
<li>Add controller method to user controller which expects a User Id and Confrimation Code

<ul>
<li>If Confirmation Code and User Id match, set Confirmed to True</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a route ex. users/1/confirm/code which maps to controller method</li>
<li>Create action mailer template which accepts User Id as parameter

<ul>
<li>Send link to confirm route</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use and observer to generate a Confirmation Code on new accounts</li>
<li>Create a helper method to check if a User Id is confirmed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create table and models for parking lot perimeters with GPS coordinates

<ul>
<li>What datatype and how many points to use to establish parking lot perimeter?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create table and models for parker's queueing statistics

<ul>
<li>Example fields:

<ul>
<li>Parking lot Id</li>
<li>User Id</li>
<li>Time enqueued</li>
<li>Time spot found</li>
<li>Time left spot</li>
<li>Park aborted</li>
<li>GPS location</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create table and models for open spots reported

<ul>
<li>Example fields:

<ul>
<li>Parking lot Id</li>
<li>User Id</li>
<li>GPS Location</li>
<li>Time reported open</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
